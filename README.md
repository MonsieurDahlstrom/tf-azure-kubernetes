  cluster_name         = "prod-aks"
  dns_prefix           = "prod-aks"
  
  vnet_id              = "/subscriptions/.../virtualNetworks/my-vnet"
  nodes_subnet_id      = "/subscriptions/.../subnets/aks-nodes"
  api_server_subnet_id = "/subscriptions/.../subnets/aks-api"
  
  default_node_pool = {
    name       = "system"
    node_count = 3
    vm_size    = "Standard_D2_v5"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

### Advanced Usage with Custom Settings

```hcl
module "aks" {
  source = "path/to/tf-azure-kubernetes"

  resource_group_name  = "my-aks-rg"
  location             = "westeurope"
  cluster_name         = "prod-aks"
  kubernetes_version   = "1.32"
  dns_prefix           = "prod-aks"
  
  vnet_id              = "/subscriptions/.../virtualNetworks/my-vnet"
  nodes_subnet_id      = "/subscriptions/.../subnets/aks-nodes"
  api_server_subnet_id = "/subscriptions/.../subnets/aks-api"
  
  network_plugin = "cilium"
  network_policy = "cilium"
  
  default_node_pool = {
    name       = "system"
    node_count = 5
    vm_size    = "Standard_D4_v5"
  }
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
    Project     = "Core Infrastructure"
    ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Private cluster with VNet integration for API server
- User-assigned managed identity for secure Azure resource access
- Workload identity for secure pod authentication
- Cilium networking with enhanced observability
- Auto-scaling for resource optimization
- Automatic image cleaning for reduced attack surface
- System node pools with taints to isolate system workloads
- Advanced Container Networking Services provides:
  - **Container Network Observability**: Enhanced visibility into network traffic
  - **Container Network Security**: FQDN filtering and other security features

## Advanced Container Networking Services

This module enables Advanced Container Networking Services (ACNS), which includes:

1. **Container Network Observability**: Provides deep insights into your network traffic by leveraging Hubble metrics, CLI, and UI. This helps with:
   - Detecting and determining root causes of network issues
   - Monitoring application performance
   - Ensuring security compliance

2. **Container Network Security**: For clusters using Azure CNI Powered by Cilium (as configured in this module), this provides:
   - DNS-based policies (FQDN filtering)
   - Simplified configuration management by using domain names instead of IP addresses
   - Enhanced security control over network policies

> **Note**: Advanced Container Networking Services is a paid offering. For more information about pricing, see [Advanced Container Networking Services - Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/kubernetes-service/).
